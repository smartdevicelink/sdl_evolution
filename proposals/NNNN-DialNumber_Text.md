## Introduction

This proposal adds a text string to `DialNumber` so that apps can be more descriptive or user friendly with it.
## Motivation

Currently when an app sends a DialNumber, the app is stuck with whatever text the HMI has baked in with it.
To enable some more user friendly experiences with DialNumber, we'd like to add a text string to it so that we can provide a friendlier message.

### Current
All apps have to use the same message when dialing a phone number:

### Future
Apps can use a different message based on the use case:

<img src="../assets/proposals/NNNN-DialNumber_Text/Future Dial Number.png" alt="Future Dial Number" class="inline" height= "50%" width= "50%" /> 


## Proposed solution
Add a text field to DialNumber in the MOBILE_API and HMI_API. 
The HMI would still need to display the phone number and a call button so that the user understands that a call is about to be placed. If the app doesn't send a message, the HMI would just display the standard string that they currently do for `DialNumber`.

```xml
    <function name="DialNumber" functionID="DialNumberID" messagetype="request" since="3.0">
    .
    .
    .
        <param name="messageText" type="Common.TextFieldStruct" mandatory="false" since="X.X">
            <description>
              Body of text to display to the user.
            </description>
        </param>
    </function>
```

## Potential downsides

Added complexity to the HMI

## Impact on existing code

The additional parameter would be ignored on older headunits, so nothing needs to be done.

## Alternatives considered

None
