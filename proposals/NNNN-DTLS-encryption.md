# DTLS encryption

* Proposal: [SDL-NNNN](NNNN-DTLS-encryption.md)
* Author: [Melnyk Tetiana](https://github.com/TMelnyk)
* Status: **Awaiting review**
* Impacted Platforms: Core/Protocol


## Introduction

This proposal is to use DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) instead of TLS for protected service handshake, encryption and decryption.

## Motivation

It makes sense for services to be protected. The DTLS protocol provides communications privacy for datagram protocols. The protocol allows client/server applications to communicate in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery. The DTLS protocol is based on the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol and provides equivalent security guarantees. Datagram semantics of the underlying transport are preserved by the DTLS protocol.

## Proposed solution

1. SDL must ignore malformed packet during processing of encrypted payloads using DTLS protocol.   
In case the value of "Protocol" param is DTLSv1.0 at [Security Manager] section of .ini file and mobile app successfully opens encrypted service (TLS handshake was succesfull) and at least one of encrypted packet is malformed due to any reason (per) _SDL must_:   
   - ignore this malformed packet;
   - search for the next valid header;   
   - continue processing of the next valid encrypted packet.   

2. SDL must support DTLS encryption for protected services.
In case the value of "Protocol" param is DTLSv1.0 at [Security Manager] section of .ini file _SDL must_:   
   - perform protected service handshake;   
   - encryption;  
   - decryption using DTLSv1.0 protocol.   

3. The "Protocol" parameter at .ini file of [Security Manager] section defines the version of encryption protocol and must be used for:   
a) protected service handshake,   
b) encryption   
c) decryption by SDL.   

## Detailed design
There is not a lot that should be changed
1. Add new parameter to SDL ini file called `DTLSv1.0`
  * add appropriate implementation to profile.cc and profile.h
2. Implement proper processing of the mentined above parameter in SDL. As SDL uses `OpenSSL` library all neccessary supporting already exists
all we need to add is proper initialization as `method = is_server ? DTLSv1_server_method() : DTLSv1_client_method();`


## Impact on existing code
There is no any impact on the existed code apart of mentioned above. This is quite small changes.

## Alternatives considered
No alternatives considered.
