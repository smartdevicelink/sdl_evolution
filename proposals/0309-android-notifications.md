# Mitigating Android SDL service notifications issues

* Proposal: [SDL-0309](0309-android-notifications.md)
* Author: [Kujtim Shala](https://github.com/kshala-ford), [Ashwin Karemore](https://github.com/ashwink11)
* Status: **Rejected**
* Impacted Platforms: [Java Suite]

## Introduction

This proposal addresses an issue with Android SDL notifications forcing SDL apps to become potentially intrusive to all users with or without owning an SDL capable vehicle.

## Motivation

The SDL Android library uses Android Services for the SDL router service and the app-specific SDL manager service. With Android Oreo, Google introduced background restrictions for Android Services. As a result, Android Services need to start in the foreground with foreground notifications in order to operate while the application is in the background. The SDL Android library creates one foreground notification for the SDL router service upon Bluetooth connection. If the router service established a connection to an SDL enabled device, each SDL application will create a foreground notification for the app-specific SDL manager service. 


Notifications appearing on users' Android devices during SDL connection are shown below.

This is the first notification shown to the user when the mobile device connects to any Bluetooth device. This "Waiting for connection" notification will be shown for both SDL enabled and the non-SDL enabled Bluetooth devices.

![All notifications](../assets/proposals/0309-android-notifications/all_noti.png)

The above two notifications are shown by an SDL app when the mobile device is connected to the SDL enabled system. The app developers cannot influence the described behavior of these notifications. None of the foreground notifications can be dismissed like other notifications, such as push notifications. To remove or avoid showing the foreground notification, the service must be stopped programmatically. Hence, the user cannot remove the notification except by force closing the application from the device's settings menu. Another option would be to hide that notification. However, many users do not want any service to run in the background if it is not doing any useful task for them. If the user doesn't have an SDL enabled system, running an SDL service on his device would not make any sense. 

Notification details provided on the SDL Developer Portal below.

Over time, many users keep complaining about the notifications shown to the user for no reason. For example, users complained recently that notifications are shown when they connect to non-SDL enabled Bluetooth devices (e.g. Bluetooth headset, Bluetooth speakers, etc.). 

Some users have left complaints in the Google Play Store for apps integrating the latest version of the Android library in the past few months.

1. **"...option to turn off SmartDeviceLink...App constantly popping up notifications...dont want this app doing anything in the background."**

2. **"...quite good app but I've had to uninstall...I cann't even find any info about how to disable it..."**

3. Translated: **"Privacy issue...It connects or analyzes my Polar M400 sports-watch without consent..."**

**Feedback from App Partners**

Below are comments on SDL `Waiting for connection` notifications received from app partners.

1.  "...the constant notifications that kept appearing at the top of many usersâ€™ screens saying app is searching for connection...but given the amount of negative feedback this has generated from users via the Play store and Twitter, we have made the difficult decision to remove the functionality..."

2. "...the notification shows for seconds and disappears, but this is quite a bad UX since all the users will be affected and the number of users that connect their devices to Bluetooth speakers/earphones is huge. We already received multiple bad reviews about this from our BETA testers. So, please consider fixing this asap..."

Here are some links from forum discussions in the past years. Similar to the above comments, the users in the below discussion forums complain about these SDL notifications.

This proposal describes a way in which app developers can control SDL behavior by using APIs to enable or disable it.

## Proposed solution

Proposed solution is described below.

### Provide API for app developers to enable/disable SDL in Android proxy

The Android proxy should provide an API to enable/disable SDL. The router service should be enabled by default. This would help many app developers to provide a setting in their app so that users can disable it if they don't have access to an SDL enabled system. This API will not influence the behavior of other SDL apps available on the users' devices.

If the SDL router service is already connected to the SDL enabled vehicle, the disable API will not have any effect on the current SDL router service session. The settings will take effect in the next run. This avoids app disconnections if the user is connected to an SDL enabled system.

The below example shows a static function that can be used by app developers to enable or disable the router service. The implementation within the SDL broadcast receiver to avoid starting the router service is internal, hence it should be considered a development detail.

```java
public class SdlRouterService extends Service {
    private static boolean isRouterServiceEnabled = true;
    
    public static void setRouterServiceEnabled(boolean flag) {
        SdlRouterService.isRouterServiceEnabled = flag;
    }
}
```

### Allow users to stop SDL foreground services

As seen in user reviews on the Google Play Store, many users want a way to stop foreground service notifications. The Android Router Service notification will provide buttons on foreground notifications, which will stop the router service and hence remove the notifications. All SDL apps connected through this Android Router Service will receive `SdlManagerListener.onDestroy` when the user stops Android Router Service, and hence the apps can be notified to stop their own foreground services started for SDL. 

The SDL notification should have two buttons, `Stop Now` and `Settings`. These buttons will be shown when the user expands the notification on the Android device.

![User button to stop router service](../assets/proposals/0309-android-notifications/noti_button_1.png)

If the user clicks on the `Stop Now` button, the Android Router Service will be immediately stopped. The second button `Settings` should be shown only when the app hosting a router service provides a `PendingIntent` for the app settings page. Below is an example implementation of how an app developer can provide `PendingIntent` to be used with the `Settings` button on an Android Router Service notification. The app settings page can be used to enable/disable SDL for that specific app using the API described above.

```java
public class SdlRouterService extends Service{
   private static PendingIntent app_settings_intent=null;
    @Override
    public static void setAppSDLSettingsIntent(PendingIntent intent) {
        app_settings_intent = intent;
    }
}
```

If the SDL app did not provide `PendingIntent` for the app settings page, the Android Router Service will show only the `Stop Now` button.

## Potential downsides

The user might disable SDL using the app settings page or stop SDL services using the notification button. However, the SDL app should respect the user's choices.

## Impact on existing code

Changes only in Android SDK

* Provide APIs to enable/disable SDL services.
* Add button in service notifications to stop SDL router services.
* Allow App to set `Pending intent` to launch apps settings page from SDL notifications.

## Alternatives considered

None.
