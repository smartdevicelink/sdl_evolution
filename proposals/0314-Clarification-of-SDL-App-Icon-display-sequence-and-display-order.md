## Introduction

This proposal is to clarify the SDL app icon display sequence and the display order of icons. By doing so, we can prevent unnecessary development for the Head Unit (HU) developers and improve usability by enhancing the visuality for users.

## Motivation

Currently, the SDL app icon is displayed on the SDL app selection (menu) screen, but the sequence to display the icon is not provided. Also, there is no explicit definition of the icon's display order or additional rules, for example, grouping by app type. For these reasons, it is difficult for the HU developer to know by what specification the icons are sorted. Also, it is difficult to judge whether or not it is necessary to deal with it on the HMI side. Incidentally, it is implemented on the program code of SDL Core by the following rules:

 1. Registered apps are sorted by the ascending order of appID *1.
 2. Unregistered apps are sorted by the ascending order of policyID in the policy table. If there are duplicate policyIDs, they will be sorted by the ascending order of deviceID.

*1 appID: It is NOT the ID obtained during SDLC App Certification. It is the ID that is set when the app establishes a session and is launched based on the hash algorithm using the sessionID (set from 0 in the app registration order) and deviceHandlerID (set from 0 in the device connection order).

As a result, the display order of icons changes every launch. Furthermore, it is very poor visuality and operability (usability) because it takes a long time for the user to find an app that s/he wants to use. In order to solve these problems, we propose to clarify the display order of the SDL app icon and improve the usability by presenting the sequence and the rules of the SDL app icon display.

## Proposed solution

The following items are proposed to improve the problems mentioned above.
 1. Clarification of rule of the icon display order
 2. Clarification of icon display sequence

<b>1. Clarification of rule of the icon display order</b>
The display order of SDL app icon is performed according to the following procedures.

 1. Set the priority of the SDL app according to the `AppHMIType` priority in Table 1.
 2. When there are multiple `AppHMITypes` set in one SDL app, the `AppHMIType` with the highest priority is used as the priority of that SDL app.
 3. If multiple SDL apps have the same `AppHMIType` set, sort them according to the order the SDL apps registered in the policy table.

<b>Table 1.</b> AppHMIType priority list

| Priority | AppHMIType |
|:-:|:-:|
| 1 | NAVIGATION |
| 2 | MEDIA |
| 3 | MESSAGE |
| 4 | INFORMATION |
| 5 | COMMUNICATION |
| 6 | SOCIAL |
| 7 | PROJECTION |
| 8 | REMOTE_CONTROL |
| 9 | SYSTEM |
| 10 | DEFAULT |
| 11 | BACKGROUND_PROCESS |
| 12 | TESTING |

At first, the priority information of `AppHMIType` in Table 1 is stored in the policy table, SDL Core, and default policy table (sdl_preloaded_pt.json). Then, the first searched information is used as the `AppHMIType` priority list (priority list). During the first launch, there is no policy table, therefore it is searched in the default policy table at first, then can be searched in SDL Core to obtain the default `appHMIType` priority list. After that, the policy table has been created, so it is searched in the order: policy table->default policy table->SDL Core.

However, since the preferred `AppHMIType` priority may vary for each OEM, the OEMs can create the priority list information of `AppHMIType` and store it in their policy table. By changing the priority list of `AppHMIType` created by each OEM in the policy table, they can display the SDL app icon according to each OEM's intended order.

<b>2. Clarification of icon display sequence</b>
Currently, there is no sequence provided that demonstrates how the icon is displayed. Figure 1 shows the sequence in which the process of this proposal is added to the existing sequence from the program code of SDL Core. The black text indicates the existing order described in the program code. The red text indicates the process added by this proposal.

The contents suggested by this proposal are as follows:
- Add `SortList()` as a process to sort according to the display order of SDL app icon.
- Perform the processing of `SortList()` after processing the normal makelist (Applications_, Applications).
- Add `init()` as a process to initialize the App List used in `SortList()` every launch, and keep the priority list information of `AppHMIType` acquired from policy table, etc.

## Potential downsides

There is no potential downside since it is a modification to the current process of the SDL app icon display order.

## Impact on existing code

The existing sorting process is left as it is. Furthermore, as processes/lists related to sorting are added, SDL Core is affected. Also, since the priority information of `AppHMIType` is stored, the policy server is affected, too. However, I believe their changes are minor version changes because there are no changes in RPC and parameters.

## Alternatives considered

None.
