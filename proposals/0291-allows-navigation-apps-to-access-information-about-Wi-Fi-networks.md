# Allow navigation apps to access information about WiFi networks

## Introduction
This proposal requires all current navigation apps to include a new permission (android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE) to benefit from the issue fix as follows:
https://github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_java_suite/pull/1259


## Motivation
Currently, there are some issues with navigation apps when users enable WiFi after the navigation apps are activated.

For example:
1. SDL failed to start video streaming if users enable WiFi on the head unit after the NaviAPP is activated.
https://github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_java_suite/issues/1235
2. SDL failed to start video streaming if users enable WiFi on the phone more than 150s after the NaviAPP is activated.
https://github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_java_suite/issues/1236

To fix these issues, navigation apps need to access information about WiFi networks.

It would help SDL greatly improve the user experience on VideoStreaming via BT+WiFi.



## Proposed solution
Add manifest permission to navigation apps that allows them to access information about WiFi networks.

```xml
    <!-- Required to check if WiFi is enabled -->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
+   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE" />
```
