# RPC design refactoring

* Proposal: [SDL-0168](0168-rpc-design-refactoring.md)
* Author: [Alexander Kutsan](https://github.com/LuxoftAKutsan)
* Status: **Accepted with Revisions**
* Impacted Platforms: [Core]

## Introduction

This proposal is to rework the design of the SDL core application manager layer in order to:
 - Reduce coupling between components
 - Reduce responsibility of the ApplicationManager class
 - Provide a plugin architecture for adding additional functionality and RPC groups easily.

## Motivation

The SDL core project is actively implementing new features and new functionality.  
To keep the project maintainable, on track and to reduce risks of regression during implementation
refactoring of application manager layer is necessary.  
Currently, extending SDL functionality may require code duplication. 
The current RC module duplicates logic of the application_manager layer -- there is separate request controller, separate mechanism to call policy checks, and RPC's processing. Currently any common logic that is implemented in the application_manager layer needs to be duplicated in request controller -- this results in bugs and redundant code; it also requires more time for implementation.
Refactoring is required in order to ensure the sustainability of the project -- refactoring the existing RC RPC's with a new proposed model is immediately necessary.

The following proposed solution will provide for better management and extensibility of SDL core and RC components, without duplicating SDL core code:

## Proposed solution
#### Reduce coupling between components and use a dependency injection practice

During component construction all dependencies should be explicitly received.
This practice will improve encapsulation for the project and make code much more maintainable going forward.


#### Reduce responsibility of the ApplicationManager class 
Currently the application manager class has too many responsibilities:
 - Service location
 - Mobile/HMI RPC processing 
 - Mobile/HMI RPC sending 
 - Registration and managing mobile applications
 - Handle different states of SDL (low voltage/ video streaming / audio_path_throw ...) 
 
The purpose of this refactoring is to extract handling & sending RPC's to a separate module.
 For example, many SDL commands require the application manager only for sending RPC's; these commands do not need to know information related to other application manager responsibilities.
 Also, extracting RPC processing to separate modules will reduce regression risks related to changing functionalities in the ApplicationManager.
 
#### Provide plugin architecture for adding additional functionality and RPC groups easily.

SDL RPC's can be split into groups of RPC's related to certain functionality (for example RC or video streaming).  
These RPC's may work with functionality that is not required by other RPC's, so exposure should be limited to the RPC's group.

Adding a new RPC or groups of RPC's is currently a very complicated and unclear process.

The best solution is to adopt a plugin approach of adding new RPC's to SDL core.
This will allow OEM's to implement code for new RPC's with ease by implementing certain interfaces and providing them to SDL as a shared library.


## Detailed design

### Use dependency injection for commands 

Commands should be accepted as a list of services that they require. The mobile factory should be responsible for providing this list of dependencies.  

#### Current Approach 
```cpp

SomeCommand::SomeCommand(app_mngr);

void SomeCommand::Run() {
  application_manager->protocol_handler().do_stuff();
  application_manager->state_controller().do_stuff();
  application_manager->PolicyHandler().do_stuff();
  application_manager->resume_controller().do_stuff();
  
}
```

#### New Approach 
```cpp

SomeCommand::SomeCommand(protocol_handler, state_controller, policy_handler, resume_controller);

void SomeCommand::Run() {
  protocol_handler_.do_stuff();
  state_controller_.do_stuff();
  protocol_handler_.do_stuff();
  protocol_handler_.do_stuff();
}
```
This will simplify code and provide the possibility to add a new component to certain commands without affecting other commands.
The factory will create the command with all required parameters, so existing code will not be complicated.
RC component contains class ResourceAllocationManager. And non-RC commands should have no access to this class, so it should be passed only to RC commands. 

### Reduce responsibility of ApplicationManager class 

Logic of handling and sending RPC's should be extracted from ApplicationManager to separate components `RPCHandler`, `RPCService`.

### RPCHandler
RPCHandler class should implement interfaces ```HMIMessageObserver```, ```ProtocolObserver```, handle incoming RPC's from HMI or mobile 
and process them. 

RPCHandler responsibilities:
 - Handle HMI/Mobile RPC's in message loop
 - Class checking policies on each RPC
 - Creating command from message with Command Factories
 - Send command for execution to Request Controller
 
 ### RPCService

RPCService should provide interface for sending messages to Mobile/HMI.  
RPCService should be passed to commands for Sending RPC's using dependency injection approach.

RPCService responsibilities:
 - SendMessage to HMI/Mobile
 - Call checking policies if message is allowed to send
 - Provide Request Controller information of any incoming request that should be terminated.  

### Provide plugin architecture for easily adding extra functionality and RPC groups   

Create **PluginManager** class that will be responsible for searching and loading rpc plugins.
All commands logic should be stored in rpc plugins. 

Each RPC plugin should implement following interfaces:
 - Command Interface :
 - CommandFactory Interface : 

#### Plugins responsibilities:
 - Provide list of supported commands
 - Create commands from smart object
 - Contain command logic

SDL will provide to *Plugin* interfaces of all services on application manager layer:
 - RPCService
 - PolicyHander
 - StateController
 - ApplicationManager
 - RequestController
 - ResumeController
 - etc ...

RPC Handler will use PluginManager to get plugins that are able to process required RPC. 
RPC Handler will use Command Factory from plugin to create Command for further processing.

#### Implementation of plugins:

Within refactoring **Remote Control** and **Vehicle Data** functionality will be extracted to separate plugins.

##### Remote Control plugin:

Remote Control plugin implements following Remote Control related RPC's:
 - GetInteriorVehicleData mobile request/response
 - RC.GetInteriorVehicleData HMI request/response
 - SetInteriorVehicleData mobile request/response
 - RC.SetInteriorVehicleData HMI request/response
 - OnInteriorVehicleData mobile notification
 - RC.OnInteriorVehicleData HMI notification
 - SubscribeButton mobile request/response
 - Buttons.SubscribeButton hmi request/response
 - OnButtonPress mobile notification
 - Buttons.OnButtonPress hmi notification

 Inside plugin also should implemented :
  - `ResourceAllocationManager` : component that is responsible for acquiring module resources.
  - `RCAppExtension` : extension of Application Class that implements storing of subscriptions. 
  - `RCCommandFactory` : Command factory that is able to create all RC related commands.
   
##### Vehicle Info plugin:

Vehicle Info plugin implements following Vehicle Info related RPC's:
  - VehicleInfo.IsReady hmi notification
  - GetVehicleData mobile request/response
  - VehicleInfo.GetVehicleData HMI request/response
  - SubscribeVehicleData mobile request/response
  - VehicleInfo.SubscribeVehicleData HMI request/response
  - UnsubscribeVehicleData mobile request/response
  - VehicleInfo.UnsubscribeVehicleData HMI request/response
  - OnVehicleData mobile notification
  - VehicleInfo.OnVehicleData HMI notification
  - ReadDID mobile request/response
  - VehicleInfo.ReadDID HMI request/response
  - GetDTCs mobile request/response
  - VehicleInfo.GetDTCs HMI request/response
  - DiagnosticMessage mobile request/response
  - VehicleInfo.DiagnosticMessage HMI request/response

 Inside plugin also should implemented :
  - `VehicleInfoAppExtension` : extension of Application Class that implements storing of subscriptions. 
  - `VehicleInfoCommandFactory` : Command factory that is able to create all Vehicle Info related RPC's.
   
## Potential downsides
This change requires major changes of application manager layer. 
## Impact on existing code
This proposal requires a major version change for SDL core.
## Alternatives considered
The only alternative is to following the existing approach, duplicating the logic of application_manager layer -- this approach  is becoming unsustainable and should be avoided.
