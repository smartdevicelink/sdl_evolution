# Configuration management

* Proposal: [SDL-NNNN](xxxx-Configuration-Management.md)
* Author: [Vadym Kushnirenko](https://github.com/vkushnirenko-luxoft)
* Status: **Awaiting review**
* Impacted Platforms: [Build server]

## Introduction

This proposal is about a structure of the buiding system, running tests and keeping results of these tests.
Also a good practice to provide a set of scripts to easy manage the build system.

## Motivation

The building process should be transparent. Any person should be able to deploy build server on his side, use it and propose recomendations about improvements.
Build server configuration must be saved into files, be flexible and be applied in any moment from public resources.

## Proposed solution

Key components of build system are:
- jenkins master - it manages build/test processes,
- jenkins slaves - docker containers that build SDL with different options and run tests,
- artifactory - keeps archive with binaries and log files,
- Github - keeps Dockerfiles and Jenkins jobs, allows to keep different versions of configuration and to download a configuration at any time.
The solution proposes to use docker containers for components deployment. 
### Jenkins jobs creating.
Every task that implies alterations in Git repository should be represented as separated branch. The template for naming the branch is the following: feature/\<task name\>
All changes related to the task should be applied to this branch.
The next list of jobs will be created after creating new branch:
- push - the job run when push to github happends,
- pull request - the job run whe pull request is opened or closed,
- nightly - the job run by timer at midnight.
  
Each job runs check style scripts, cpp check, unit tests.
ATF feature test sets run after each PUSH/NIGHTLY job. 
ATF smoke test sets run after each job.

Summary, the next set of jenkins job will be created for each feature branch:
- PUSH_feature (SDL build, Unit test)
  - ATF_feature 
  - ATF_SMOKE_feature
- PR_feature (SDL build, Unit test)
  - ATF_SMOKE_feature
- NIGHTLY_feature (SDL build, Unit test, Coverage)
  - ATF_feature
  - ATF_SMOKE_feature
### 1) Jenkins - continuous integration system.
https://jenkins.io/
Jenkins is the system for automation routine operations:
- it runs jobs by timer, by trigger from github pulls and pull requests,
- it runs tests during or after succesfull finishing of building jobs and send emails to responsible persons and jenkins administrators or send notifications into slack channel,
- it has many plugins for code building, testing, email notifications,
- it is free.
### 2) Docker containers - to run clean environment quickly and scalable.
https://www.docker.com/
Docker containers allow to quickly run and stop environment for code building. At the end of job container collapses and deletes temporary files after previous job. For example, jenkins master runs docker container, then starts build process inside this container, archives artifacts and send it to artifactory, and send notifications to developers. Then it stops the container and waits for the next job.
### 3) Github - to keep Dockerfiles and Jenkins jobs.
https://github.com/
Create a repository to save to store build environment configurations. This repository includes:
- dockerfile for jenkins servers,
- dockerfile for artifactory,
- the tree of jenkins jobs with config.xml for each job,
- scripts,
- instruction how to download dockerfiles, create containers, run jenkins and run building jobs.
### 4) Artifactory - to keep artifacts - builds and test results.
https://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/
Keeps binaries and tests results as the tree of archives.
