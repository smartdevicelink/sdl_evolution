## Introduction
SDL must respond with INVALID_DATA to app due to "/" symbol. 

## Motivation  
Currently Linux SDL has NO restrictions related to "\" (backslash) symbol at `<syncFileName>` parameter.

## Proposed solution
SDL must respond with 'INVALID_DATA, success:false' resultCode in case the name of the file that app requests to upload on the system contains "\" (backslash).  

The following use case possible:  
app -> SDL: PutFile (""\" 123.jpg") -> "syncFileName" with backslash  
As result in this case SDL must return INVALID_DATA to mobile app.
