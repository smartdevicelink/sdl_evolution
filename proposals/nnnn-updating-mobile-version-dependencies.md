# Updating Mobile Version Dependencies

## Introduction

This proposal sets a meta requirement on when mobile platform dependencies should be updated.

## Motivation

We've updated the base iOS platform dependency version in the past and it was agreed that we need a stricter set of rules on when platform dependency updates should occur.

## Proposed solution

The proposed solution is the following set of guidelines:

1. If a platform dependency update would cover 97% of users, that update should occur.
2. If a platform dependency update would cover 90% of users, a proposal may be entered with reasons for the update and the proposal considered. If a proposed version would not cover 90% of users, no proposal may be entered.

The [Android platform versions website](https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html) and [iOS platform versions website](https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store/) are to be used for making these determinations.

### Android
So, for example, (1) means that the Android libraries should support v4.2.x+ (97.6% usage) and not support previous versions. If a proposal is entered and accepted, (2) means that v4.4 (94.3% usage) is the highest version permitted to be the base Android platform version.

### iOS
There is not enough information to consider (1) for the iOS platform, as everything beyond the previous version is considered "other". (2) means that iOS 10 is the highest version permitted to be the base iOS platform version (iOS 10 has greater than 93% usage).

## Potential downsides

None the authors can see.

## Impact on existing code

This is a meta change, no code will be impacted.

## Alternatives considered

Various other methods could be used to determine version updates.
