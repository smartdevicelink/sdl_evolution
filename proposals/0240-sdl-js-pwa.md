# WebEngine support for SDL JavaScript

* Proposal: [SDL-0240](0240-sdl-js-pwa.md)
* Author: [Kujtim Shala](https://github.com/kshala-ford)
* Status: **In Review**
* Impacted Platforms: [ Core / RPC / JavaScript / Server ]

## Introduction

This proposal is adding a new transport to the SDL JavaScript library to support (progressive) web apps to run on a WebEngine or a browser.

## Motivation

Applications running in vehicle opens big opportunities for SmartDeviceLink enhancing the user experience. Recent browsers allow a hardware independent runtime environment for apps with application management, sandboxing together with decent performance.

The motivation of this proposal is to provide an extensible in-vehicle infotainment system using the infotainment system as a platform and runtime for SDL applications. An in-vehicle application store (OEM store) should provide applications and services to the user. These applications and services can be installed directly into the vehicle. These applications should be independent from a mobile phone. Instead they connect to the locally running SDL Core and use the in-vehicle modem to communicate to the internet.

## Proposed solution

The proposed solution is to allow web apps to run in a WebEngine and connect to SDL Core using WebSockets. A web app is a single page application developed with web technology like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The WebEngine can be a browser that is reduced to the HTML rendering part only (without url bar, tabs etc.). The WebEngine should be on the same host as SDL Core (in the infotainment system). It can also be in the local network for development purposes.

### High level overview 

1. An OEM store should make apps available to the user. The user should be able to install or uninstall apps from the store.
2. An app should be a compressed bundle of application files, such as HTML, CSS or script files. At minimum it requires the following files:
   1. sdl.js file
   2. manifest.json file
   3. An HTML file where the manifest is pointing to
3. The manifest.json file must be included in the HTML file as a script source
4. The OEM store's backend should store the compressed app.
5. If a user installs an app, the OEM store should download and decompress the app to the system.
6. After installation, the OEM store should make the app visible and available on the HMI.
7. Core should support a WebSocket Server as a transport.
8.  If a user activates a local app through the HMI, the HMI should launch the app by opening the entrypoint HTML file.
9.  HMI should launch the app including SDL Core's hostname and port as GET parameters (file://somewhere/HelloSDL/index.html?ws-host=localhost&ws-port=123456)
10. The app should connect to Core using the SDL library using hostname and port specified.
11. If Core sends UpdateAppList, the HMI should compare matching SDL app IDs and avoid showing an app twice.

### Chapter 1: SDL support for WebEngines (foundations)
---------

This chapter focuses on the minimum requirements to have SDL support for WebEngines and Browsers. It describes a new transport for SDL Core, how apps are listed on the HMI and how they can be user activated. It also changes the registration of applications on the SDL developer portal (smartdevicelink.com) to allow defining apps as local/embedded.

#### 1.1 WebSocket transport

This proposal introduces a new runtime environment: the WebEngine. Data communication protocols are very limited in this environment. Therefore a new transport implementation should be introduced to SDL Core and the JavaScript library. 

##### 1.1.1 SDL Core

The transport for Core should be a WebSocket server which listens to a port specified in the smartDeviceLink.ini file. While SDL Core is operating, the server should be permanently available and listen for connections on the specified port. Another ini configuration should allow binding the socket to the localloop address or any address. This increases security in the production environment and allows remote connection in development systems.

The new transport should be available as a build configuration called `BUILD_WEBSOCKET_SERVER_SUPPORT` (definition `-DWEBSOCKET_SERVER_TRANSPORT_SUPPORT`) so that SDL Core can be compiled with or without this additional transport type.

##### 1.1.2 JavaScript library

On the library side, a new WebSocket client transport should be created using the [WebSocket API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Websockets_API). This transport should require a hostname or ip address with a port to connect to Core's WebSocket server. The library should also be extended to be exportable to a single .js file that can be easily included in an HTML file. This export could be done per library release using Webpack. This new transport should be specifically for WebEngine purposes and should not be included for the Node.js platform. In order to improve simple "plug-and-play" of the library, the .js file should include only this single transport.

#### 1.2 Activating a web app

Activating a local web app by a user will cause the HMI to launch the app's entrypoint HTML file in the WebEngine. Once the engine has loaded the web app, the JavaScript SDL library will initiate a WebSocket connection to SDL Core's WebSocket server port and then establish the RPC/Bulk service session.

After the app registers, the HMI will be notified with `OnAppRegistered`, which allows the HMI to return to SDL and activate the app. This will make the app HMI level set to HMI_FULL and the HMI will present the app's template. At no time the web view of the web application will be visible.

> Flow of how a user activates a web app and how it becomes visible on the screen.

#### 1.3 Mobile App properties change

Due to a new app platform, the hybrid app preference should be modified to track mobile, cloud and local apps.

##### 1.3.1 Mobile API

```xml
<enum name="HybridAppPreference" since="5.1">
  <description>Enumeration for the user's preference of which app type to use when both are available</description>
  <element name="MOBILE" />
  <element name="CLOUD" />
  <element name="BOTH" deprecated="true" since="5.x">
    <description>This element is deprecated. Using this element will be equal to "ALL". Please use ALL instead.</description>
    <history>
      <element name="BOTH" since="5.1" />
    </history>
  </element>
  <element name="LOCAL" since="5.x" />
  <element name="ALL" since="5.x" />
</enum>
```

App registration on the SDL Developer Portal (smartdevicelink.com) should allow a developer to specify an app as a local web app. As the app platforms increase (2 -> 3) a new way to specify preferences should be introduced. The element `BOTH` should be deprecated and replaced by `ALL` for a next major release. Occurrences of `BOTH` would be treated as `ALL`.

### 1.4 HMI API using App Properties RPCs

The HMI API should be extended to set app properties to SDL Core. This addition should allow the HMI to add app policy IDs to the policy database as they are installed by the embedded OEM catalog.

The HMI API extension is mostly a copy of the cloud-app-properties included in the mobile API. 

1. The OEM store uses `SetAppProperties` using the manifest data.
2. The OEM store may choose to add not-installed apps to SDL using `enabled` parameter set to `false` (optional)
3. If an embedded app is installed the `enabled` flag should be set to `true` to appear in UpdateAppsList RPC
4. For local apps
  1. "cloudTransportType" will be "ws" (WebSocket) or "wss" (WebSocket-Secure)
  2. "endpoint" parameter will be omitted. Instead the HMI is responsible to launch local apps.
5. If Core doesn't know the app ID it should ask HMI for a policy update.
  1. Alternatively HMI can call `UpdateSDL` after setting app properties to enforce SDL to peform the policy update.
6. Policy HMI impl. (incl. SYNCP) should have the ability to use embedded modem to send policy snapshot to the policy server.

#### 1.5 App presentation with Templates

The default app presentation approach should be template based. With the web app becoming active on the HMI, the HMI should present the application template. The body of the index.html file of the web app should be empty and should not be modified with scripts as the app won't be visible on the HMI anyway. The HMI should show the system component responsible for SDL templates. This component would receive the `Show` RPCs provided by the app.

### Chapter 2: Web application package
---------

Running apps on an embedded WebEngine defines a new app platform/runtime. With installing an app on the infotainment system there should be a minimum set of requirements on how the app should be packaged.

1. The app package should be a compressed zip file
2. It should contain a manifest.json and the sdl.js file
3. The manifest file should contain:
   1. a relative path to an html file which is the entry point of the app
   2. a relative path to an app icon in the app bundle
   3. SDL app ID
   4. app name
   5. optionally per supporting SDL locale:
      1. app name (overrides global app name) (must be one of the valid app nicknames)
      2. optionally relative path to an app icon (overrides global app icon)
      3. optionally TTS name (an array of tts chunks)
      4. optionally VR app names (an array of strings)
   6. App version
   7. Min SDL version supported
4. All script files should be included in the package
   1. Any `<script>` element with `src` attribute should point to a script file in the package
   2. No scripts from outside the package should be allowed
5. The entry point HTML file should refer to the manifest file (`<script src="manifest.json" />`)

Above metadata may be used for the OEM app store and for presenting the app on the HMI (including voice capability). See appendix for an example manifest file.

This definition should ensure that apps can be approved and verified by SDLC and OEMs without possibility of modifications after approval. Also this set of requirements should ensure compatibility throughout integrators. The final approval process will be part of another proposal.

## Potential downsides

The upside of apps running with a WebEngine is that it comes with an extremely flexible html based user interface and with a very sandboxed runtime environment. This can also be seen as a downside as the responsibility of following driver distraction rules increases and a sandbox environment is limiting the functionality of apps.

## Impact on existing code

1. Core needs a new transport type to support a WebSocket Server.
2. The JavaScript library needs a new transport type to support WebSocket Client.
3. App registration on SDL Developer Portal (smartdevicelink.com) needs a new field for local apps.

## Alternatives considered

Local Node.js or Java were considered as alternative options for locally running applications. However both options have downsides:
1. Both are difficult to sandbox. Compared to a web engine the effort to sandbox a Node.js or java application and to protect the vehicle system are very high.
2. Limited app availability. App developers would potentially need to reassemble a good portion of existing code and write new code to make locally running applications possible.
3. Licensing and compatibility. License cost may apply for embedded in-vehicle use. Efforts avoiding license using older versions may cause compatiblity issues leading to code rewrite. Open source variants may cause other license issues.

Many services are available over a web application and modern WebEngines provide a good sandboxing ability.
