# WebEngine support for SDL JavaScript

* Proposal: [SDL-0240](0240-sdl-js-pwa.md)
* Author: [Kujtim Shala](https://github.com/kshala-ford)
* Status: **Accepted with Revisions**
* Impacted Platforms: [ Core / RPC / JavaScript / Server / SHAID / Manticore ]

## Introduction

This proposal is adding a new transport to the SDL JavaScript library to support (progressive) web apps to run on a WebEngine or a browser.

## Motivation

Applications running in vehicle opens big opportunities for SmartDeviceLink enhancing the user experience. Recent browsers allow a hardware independent runtime environment for apps with application management, sandboxing together with decent performance.

The motivation of this proposal is to provide an extensible in-vehicle infotainment system using the infotainment system as a platform and runtime for SDL applications. An in-vehicle application store (OEM store) should provide applications and services to the user. These applications and services can be installed directly into the vehicle. These applications should be independent from a mobile phone. Instead they connect to the locally running SDL Core and use the in-vehicle modem to communicate to the internet.

## Proposed solution

The proposed solution is to allow web apps to run in a WebEngine and connect to SDL Core using WebSockets. A web app is a single page application developed with web technology like HTML, CSS and JavaScript using the SDL JavaScript library. The WebEngine can be a browser that is reduced to the HTML rendering part only (without url bar, tabs etc.). The WebEngine should be on the same host as SDL Core (in the infotainment system). It can also be in the local network for development purposes.

### High level overview 

1. An OEM store should make apps available to the user. The user should be able to install or uninstall apps from the store.
2. An app should be a compressed bundle of application files, such as HTML, CSS or script files. At minimum it requires the following files:
   1. sdl.js file
   2. manifest.js file
   3. An HTML file where the manifest is pointing to
3. The manifest.js file must be included in the HTML file as a script source
4. The OEM store's backend should store the compressed app copied from the SDL Developer Portal (smartdevicelink.com) after the app and version is approved by the SDLC and the OEM. 
   1. Note: Neither the SDL Developer Portal nor the SDL Server or SHAID are directly involved in distributing the app package to vehicles. 
5. If a user installs an app, the OEM store should download the app package from the OEM backend and decompress/install the app to the system.
6. After installation, the OEM store should make the app visible and available on the HMI.
7. Core should support a WebSocket Server as a transport.
8.  If a user activates a local app through the HMI, the HMI should launch the app by opening the entrypoint HTML file.
9.  HMI should launch the app including SDL Core's hostname and port as GET parameters.
10. The app should connect to Core using the SDL library using hostname and port specified.
11. If Core sends UpdateAppList, the HMI should compare matching SDL app IDs and avoid showing an app twice.

### Chapter 1: Web application package
---------

Running apps on an embedded WebEngine defines a new app platform/runtime. With installing an app on the infotainment system there should be a minimum set of requirements on how the app should be packaged.

1. The app package should be a compressed zip file
2. It should contain a manifest.js and the sdl_javascript library file for web applications (e.g. sdl.js)
3. The manifest file should contain:
   1. A relative path to an html file which is the entrypoint of the app
   2. A relative path to an app icon in the app bundle
   3. SDL app ID
      1. Note that with this new platform we don't recommend proceeding with an additional short app ID. Only the full SDL app uuid should be used.
   4. App name
      1. Must be one of the valid policy nicknames
   5. Primary Category / App HMI Type
      1. A field that should contain one of the enum elements from "AppHMIType" of the MOBILE_API
   6. Optional Additional Categories / App HMI Types
   7. Optional per supporting SDL locale:
      1. App name (overrides global app name) (must be one of the valid app nicknames)
      2. Optional relative path to an app icon (overrides global app icon)
      3. Optional TTS name (an array of tts chunks)
      4. Optional VR app names (an array of strings)
   8. App version
      1. Note this version should be human readible and selected by the app developer.
      2. The format should be three numeric values separated by a "." character.
      3. The first value indicates the major app version, followed by the minor version and the optional "patch" version.
      4. Example: "1.0.0"
   9. Min SDL RPC version supported
   10. Min SDL Protocol version supported
4. All script files should be included in the package
   1. Any `<script>` element with `src` attribute should point to a script file in the package
   2. No scripts from outside the package should be allowed
5. The entrypoint HTML file should refer to the manifest file (`<script type="module" src="manifest.js" />`)
   1. Note the type set to module may be required to achieve importing the SDL manifest and make it available to the SDL library. This should be an implementation detail.

#### 1.1 Manifest file

> Note: See appendix for an example manifest file

The SDL Developer Portal should allow developers to enter all app information that are relevant for the app manifest file in the "App Info" section. The SDL Developer Portal should also allow generating a manifest file based on the entered app information. This generated manifest file should be used by the app developer within the web application.

App developers should be able to upload app packages and mark them as candidates for app certification. The platform can read the manifest file to verify it matches the app information for the specified app version.

The backend of the OEM store should store copies of a certified app package if the OEM has accepted and approved the app. The OEMs don't need to read the manifest file for the OEM store database. Instead the app information and assets should be read from the OEM policy server (SDL Server) via a supporting API endpoint. This need should be an implementation detail as the data offered by the API is already defined in the proposal.

The SDL JavaScript library should use the manifest file by reading the exported const to automatically send `RegisterAppInterface` and `ChangeRegistration` instead of using a configuration or builder pattern. The  SDL library may need a new method to attempt to import and utilize the manifest.js contents. This need should be an implementation detail as it would only affect library internals.

This definition should ensure that apps can be approved and verified by the SDLC and OEMs without possibility of modifications after approval. Also this set of requirements should ensure compatibility throughout integrators. The final approval process will be part of another proposal.

### Chapter 2: SDL support for WebEngines
---------

This chapter focuses on the minimum requirements to have SDL support for WebEngines and Browsers. It describes a new transport for SDL Core, how apps are listed on the HMI and how they can be user activated. It also changes the registration of applications on the SDL developer portal (smartdevicelink.com) to allow defining apps as local/embedded.

#### 2.1 WebSocket transport

This proposal introduces a new runtime environment: the WebEngine. Data communication protocols are very limited in this environment. Therefore a new transport implementation should be introduced to SDL Core and the JavaScript library. 

##### 2.1.1 SDL Core

The transport for Core should be a WebSocket server which listens to a port specified in the smartDeviceLink.ini file. While SDL Core is operating, the server should be permanently available and listen for connections on the specified port. Another ini configuration should allow binding the socket to the localloop address or any address. This increases security in the production environment and allows remote connection in development systems.

The new transport should be available as a build configuration called `BUILD_WEBSOCKET_SERVER_SUPPORT` (definition `-DWEBSOCKET_SERVER_TRANSPORT_SUPPORT`) so that SDL Core can be compiled with or without this additional transport type.

##### 2.1.2 JavaScript library

On the library side, a new WebSocket client transport should be created using the [WebSocket API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Websockets_API). This transport should require a hostname or ip address with a port to connect to Core's WebSocket server. The library should also be extended to be exportable to a single .js file that can be easily included in an HTML file. This export could be done per library release using Webpack. This new transport should be specifically for WebEngine purposes and should not be included for the Node.js platform. In order to improve simple "plug-and-play" of the library, the .js file should include only this single transport.

##### 2.1.3 GET parameters

The JavaScript library should read GET parameters to identify how to connect to SDL. The library should listen to these three parameters:

1. `sdl-host` which can be an IP address, hostname or a URL to a host
2. `sdl-port` which should be the port number of SDL Core
3. `sdl-transport-role` which defines the transport type and role. Following roles should be valid: `ws-server`, `ws-client`, `wss-server`, `wss-client`, `tcp-server`, `tcp-client`

For the WebSocket transport as suggested in this proposal, the transport role would be `ws-server` or `wss-server` where `sdl-host` points to the host that runs SDL Core (in production that would be the IVI system so local host) and `sdl-port` is the port number that SDL Core bound the WebSocket to.

Example: `file://somewhere/HelloSDL/index.html?sdl-host=localhost&sdl-port=12345&sdl-transport-role=wss-server`

#### 2.2 Activating a web app

Activating a local web app by a user will cause the HMI to launch the app's entrypoint HTML file in the WebEngine. Once the engine has loaded the web app, the JavaScript SDL library will initiate a WebSocket connection to SDL Core's WebSocket server port and then establish the RPC/Bulk service session.

After the app registers, the HMI will be notified with `OnAppRegistered`, which allows the HMI to return to SDL and activate the app. This will make the app HMI level set to HMI_FULL and the HMI will present the app's template. At no time the web view of the web application will be visible.

![Flow of user activating a web app](../assets/proposals/0240-sdl-js-pwa/activate-web-app.png)

> Flow of how a user activates a web app and how it becomes visible on the screen.

#### 2.3 (No) Changes to Hybrid App Preferences

Due to a new app platform, the complexity of supporting hybrid app preferences will increase. Fortunately no changes to the logic are required for the implementation of this proposal. The hybrid app preferences documentation should be extended for how to use this feature and also include this additional platform.

The documentation should mention that the hybrid app preference value `CLOUD` is equivalent to a non-mobile app preference and the value `BOTH` is equivalent to preferring all applications. The documentation should also state that hybrid app preference values should match across all app variants and that each non-mobile application can be enabled or disabled individually using the "enabled" flag.

### 2.4 HMI API using App Properties RPCs

The HMI API should be extended to set app properties to SDL Core. This addition should allow the HMI to add app policy IDs to the policy database as they are installed by the embedded OEM catalog.

The HMI API extension is mostly a copy of the cloud-app-properties included in the mobile API. 

1. The OEM store uses app data in SDL Server (synchronized from SHAID) for `SetAppProperties`.
2. The OEM store may choose to add not-installed apps to SDL using `enabled` parameter set to `false` (optional)
3. If an embedded app is installed the `enabled` flag should be set to `true` to appear in UpdateAppsList RPC
4. For local apps
   - "cloudTransportType" will be "ws" (WebSocket) or "wss" (WebSocket-Secure)
   - "endpoint" parameter will be omitted. Instead the HMI is responsible to launch local apps.
5. If Core doesn't know the app ID it should ask HMI for a policy update.
   - Alternatively HMI can call `UpdateSDL` after setting app properties to enforce SDL to perform the policy update.
6. Policy HMI impl. (incl. SYNCP) should have the ability to use embedded modem to send policy snapshot to the policy server.

#### 2.5 App presentation with Templates

The default app presentation approach should be template based. With the web app becoming active on the HMI, the HMI should present the application template. The body of the index.html file of the web app should be empty and should not be modified with scripts as the app won't be visible on the HMI anyway. The HMI should show the system component responsible for SDL templates. This component would receive the `Show` RPCs provided by the app.

#### 2.6 App update and certification

As already mentioned, app packages are uploaded to the SDL Developer Portal. App developers may also update the application by uploading new app packages. The backend of the OEM store should store copies of a certified app package if the OEM accepted and approved the app. 

As a result, managing app updates is the responsibility of the OEMs. App packages hosted on the SDL Developer Portal must not be made available directly to vehicles. Instead OEMs must download and host a copy app packages to their SDL Servers using the file URL from the SHAID API (see additions to SHAID). An OEM will need to implement a file saving feature into their server installation for this behavior to work. If needed by the OEM, the OEM store backend should be able to store app packages of different versions. The OEM store client should list and allow installation of supported apps only, dependent on the vehicle software version, SDL Core version, and app's min SDL (RPC or Protocol) version.

An app certification review should be performed on apps provided on the SDL Developer Portal before they are made available to OEMs and vehicles. The initial submission of a WebEngine application will undergo SDLC app certification testing. Once the initial submission has passed certification, future submissions will not be required to undergo full certification testing but may be subject to additional certification tests/requirements. The SDLC app certification review will not test every detail and aspect of the application. The review will not guarantee that the app behaves the same in OEM vehicles. Therefore the OEMs should consider functional tests for each release to a depth they feel is necessary to make sure the app is of a desired quality.

The current app certification guidelines should be extended to include tests that are valid for in-vehicle web applications. It should not include tests to monitor data traffic with respect to effort and cost to perform such tests. The app certification for in-vehicle web applications cannot take place until the certification guidelines are updated. The app certification guideline update for web applications must be complete before this feature is released.

### Chapter 3: App Info Additions

There are several additions needed for the Developer Portal (smartdevicelink.com), SHAID and the SDL Server to deliver the App Info and a url to an app package.

#### 3.1 Developer Portal

The following additions should be made in the SDL Developer Portal when registering an Application:

- Allow specifying WebEngine or Cloud Transport Adapter when Embedded is selected as the app Platform.
- Allow entering an HTML filename as the app entrypoint (instead of an endpoint url)
- Allow selecting optional additional categories
- Allow specifying supporting languages/locales
- Per supporting locale
  - Allow selecting an app name from the list of app name aliases
  - Allow uploading a locale specific app icon
  - Allow entering an app TTS name (as simple text or in advanced mode as TTS chunks)
  - Allow entering app VR names (as list of text)
- Allow specifying an app version as string
- Allow selecting an SDL RPC Version as the minimum supported RPC version
- Allow selecting an SDL Protocol Version as the minimum supported Protocol version

The SDL Developer Portal should provide an option to generate an app manifest out of the entered app information. Also the Developer Portal should allow uploading app packages per app version.

#### 3.2 SHAID changes

SHAID should provide additional information in the `Application` structure. The additions are related to the additional app info as well as to the available app packages.

Manifest | Exists in SHAID | SHAID Addition
---- | ----- | -----
App ID | `Application.uuid` | _No_
App HMI Type | `Application.category` |  _No_
Additional App HMI Types | _No_ | `Application.additional_categories`
App Name | `Application.display_names[0]` |  _No_
App Icon | `Application.icon_url` |  _No_
App Version | _No_ | `Application.platform_app_version`
SDL Min RPC Version | _No_ | `Application.min_rpc_version`
SDL Min Protocol Version | _No_ | `Application.min_protocol_version`
App locales | _No_ | `Application.locales` for objects of type `Locale`
App Name per locale | _No_ | `Locale.display_name`
App Icon per locale | _No_ | `Locale.icon_url`
TTS Name per locale | _No_ | `Locale.tts_name`
VR Names per locale | _No_ | `Locale.vr_names`

The parameter `Application.locales` should hold a list of objects for locale information. The locale key format should be based on [RFC 5646](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646). If needed, the RFC format is convertible allowing easy comparisons with existing language fields within SDL (e.g. Language enum in the mobile API). See below example for an English and German example.

```json
...
"locales": {
    "de_DE": { ... },
    "en_US": { ... }
}
...
```

The application package should be included in the `Application` struct as `Application.package_url`. SHAID should only allow downloading app packages with a valid and authorized key using the existing SHAID security mechanism.

#### 3.3 SDL Server changes

The SDL server should extend the application related database tables to store the 
- Additional categories
- App info per supported locale (e.g. in an `application_locale` sub-table)
- App package version and Min Version info (e.g. in an `application.package` sub-table).

## Potential downsides

The upside of apps running with a WebEngine is that it comes with a very sandboxed runtime environment. This can also be seen as a downside as a sandbox environment is limiting the functionality of apps.

## Impact on existing code

1. Core needs a new transport type to support a WebSocket Server.
2. The JavaScript library needs a new transport type to support WebSocket Client.
3. App registration on SDL Developer Portal (smartdevicelink.com) needs a new field for local apps.
4. SHAID changes to store and return the new data items displayed on the Developer Portal.
5. SDL Server changes to store copies of newly added SHAID data items and provide a customizable skeleton method for copying app packages from SHAID to an OEM-provided storage solution.
6. Manticore should expose Core's WebSocket Server port to allow developers to test their WebEngine apps.

## Alternatives considered

Local Node.js or Java were considered as alternative options for locally running applications. However both options have downsides:
1. Limited app availability. App developers would potentially need to reassemble a good portion of existing code and write new code to make locally running applications possible.
2. Licensing and compatibility. License cost may apply for embedded in-vehicle use. Efforts avoiding license using older versions may cause compatibility issues leading to code rewrite. Open source variants may cause other license issues.

Many services are available over a web application and modern WebEngines provide a good sandboxing ability.
