# Template Titles

* Proposal: [SDL-NNNN](NNNN-template-titles.md)
* Author: [Joel Fischer](https://github.com/joeljfischer)
* Status: **Awaiting review**
* Impacted Platforms: [Core / iOS / Android / RPC]

## Introduction

Templates should have the capability to have a title to help orient the user in the UI.

## Motivation

Basic templates have nothing to orient the user to where they are in the UI. A title allows the user to know what the content of the current screen is showing them. For example, a weather app may have several template screens: the current weather, an hourly view, and a daily view. Without titles, the user must rely on knowing the button they've pressed and their intuition to know what screen they are on.

## Proposed solution

```xml
<function name="SetDisplayLayout" functionID="SetDisplayLayoutID" messagetype="request">
    <!-- Existing RPC -->
    <description>
        Used to set an alternate display layout.
        If not sent, default screen for given platform will be shown
    </description>

    <param name="displayLayout" type="String" maxlength="500" mandatory="true">
        <description>
            Predefined or dynamically created screen layout.
            Currently only predefined screen layouts are defined.
        </description>
    </param>

    <!-- New Additions -->
    <param name="title" type="String" maxlength="100" mandatory="false">
        <description>
            The title of the new template that will be displayed. 
            How this will be displayed is dependent on the OEM designing the implementation of the template.
        </description>
    </param>
</function>
```
