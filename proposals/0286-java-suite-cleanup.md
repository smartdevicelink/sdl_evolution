# Java Suite Cleanup

* Proposal: [SDL-0286](0286-java-suite-cleanup.md)
* Author: [Joey Grover](https://github.com/joeygrover)
* Status: **Accepted**
* Impacted Platforms: [Java Suite]

## Introduction
The Java Suite (formerly Android) repo has progressed without the need for a major version for over four years. However, it is time to remove old code from the project and create a more streamlined library. This proposal will go over the changes that are needed to clean up the Java Suite library.

## Motivation
Ever since the introduction of the Java SE and EE sections of the library, the Java Suite library has been preparing for a major version. New classes have been put into place that will take over for old, deprecated classes. The old classes carry a lot of technical debt with an exorbitant number of public methods, outdated design patterns, and misaligned architecture. The new structure present in the pure Java sections of the library show how much cleaner the SDL stack could be.

There is also a learning curve in trying to understand the current project structure for both new developers and occasional contributors. The existing structure was only meant to be a bridge until we could make a breaking change. Now that we have more people contributing to the project, it's important to make it as easy as possible for them to understand and be able to effectively contribute.

## Proposed solution

### Remove requirement for baseAndroid folder
The `baseAndroid` folder contains symbolic links to certain source files and folders. This was done in order to reuse as much code as possible without causing a breaking change in the Android sub-project of the Java Suite. It works well on Unix-based systems, however, Windows doesn't like the symbolic links and requires an extra script to create them on the machine during compilation. It is a less than ideal process.

If we create a breaking change, we can move the Android sub-project to all the same layers as the Java SE and EE projects. This will allow the Android sub-project to use the same `base` source set folder and remove the symbolic link source set folder that is currently used.

### Consistent Formatting
Over the lifetime of the library, some coding standards have been missed or changed. The library should have a formatter run on it to provide consistent formatting to all files. This will likely touch most files and could be seen as a very large change, but while the source files will change, the code itself will remain the same. These changes will also be added to a coding style guide in the Java Suite repository.

1. Copyright should be at the top of all files in a comment block before all code.
2. Spaces not tabs. All tabbed indents will be changed to four spaces.
3. All public methods should have JavaDoc 
4. Correct camel-case for code objects. 
    1. All methods and local variables should be camel-case starting with a lower-case letter (e.g. sdlManager).
    2. All class names should be camel-case starting with an upper-case letter (e.g. SdlSession, ScreenManager).
    3. All class packages should be lower case with no special characters (e.g. com.smartdevicelink.managers).
5. Proper spacing between arguments and keywords. For example

Wrong:
```java
if(x==y)
{
    z=1;
}
else{
    z=0;
}
``` 

Right:
```java
if (x == y) {
    z = 1;
} else {
    z = 0;
}
``` 

### Remove Deprecated Code
Most or all deprecated code will be removed at the Project Maintainer's discretion. This will include all the old layers of `SdlConnection`, `SdlSession` (Android version), and `WiProProtocol`. Since the acceptance and integration of proposal [SDL 0194 - Android Transport Layer Overhaul](https://github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_evolution/blob/master/proposals/0194-android-transport-overhaul.md), these layers are no longer needed and only bloat the library while preventing the use of the `base` source set folder.

#### Remove old transports
Since all transports have moved to the router service, the old versions of those transports should be removed. Once the old `SdlProxyALM` code path is removed, the `SdlConnection` and supporting classes will also be removed resulting in the old transports being unused.

### Update the AndroidX Support
The current support library has been deprecated and needs to be updated. The new library package that Google is pushing developers to use is `AndroidX` aka `Android Jetpack`. The current support library does not function alongside the `AndroidX` package so app developers are currently forced to use the support library which is now deprecated.

### Misc

#### Force proper integrations
If the library detects that an integration is incorrect it currently just logs a warning. With this major release an exception should be thrown in those cases so that developers know to make fixes right away. For example, if the supplied `SdlRouterService` is from the library and not an extension in their app the library would throw an exception:

```java
if(localRouterClass.getName().equalsIgnoreCase(com.smartdevicelink.transport.SdlRouterService.class.getName())){
    throw new Exception("Can't use default SdlRouterService class, must be extended in your project");
}
```

This should also be done for incorrect implementations of the `meta-data` entries needed for a successful integration. These exceptions should be wrapped with a check to only cause this during debug builds and not production.

#### Add more annotations
Where it is possible to use more annotations, they will be added to help create predictable and error free development. Some of the new annotations we will be adding:

- [@CallSuper](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#call-super): overridden methods must call super
- [@RestrictTo](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#restrict): defines the visibility of a method/member variable (ie, subclasses, library, etc)

#### Refactor Package and Class Names

As previously described in the "Consistent Formatting" section, some of the packages and class names don't follow the Java standard. These include package names that have capital letters in them. Other classes are in packages that don't align well; these would be moved to packages that fit them better. For example, `SystemCapabilityManager` is in the proxy package, but should be in the manager package. `SdlSession` is in the `SdlConnection` package but can be moved to another package such as `proxy` or `protocol` where that makes more sense. 

##### Refactor Sample Projects and Unit Test Folders

The JavaSE and JavaEE sample projects should mimic the same folder structure as the Android project, so this cleanup should work to match that. Platform-specific unit tests will also be moved into more project-specific folders to enable platform-specific unit test runs. 

### Implement Accepted Proposals

#### SDL-0203 Cloud App Library - Phase 1 
> #### Implement sdl\_java\_common back into SDL Android Library
>
>After the creation of the common library, the SDL Android library will then need to include the sdl\_java\_common library and make the necessary changes to support it. This is almost guaranteed to be a breaking change so its timing could be pushed from the initial start of the proposal implementation.

This will contain the largest amount of breaking changes. It will include moving the Android project onto the new manager layer away from the deprecated `proxy` classes and use the new `LifecycleManager` exclusively.

#### SDL-0193 Update SDL-Android minimum SDK
>With the progression of SDL Android as a library, it has become necessary to update the minimum supported SDK from 8. The proposed minimum SDK will be API 16, Jelly Bean.

This would be an appropriate time to implement this accepted proposal. 

## Potential downsides
- Developers using any of the deprecated classes or integration methods will have to update their integration if they want to update their library version. This includes developers using the old `SdlProxyBase/ALM` integration as those classes will be removed.

## Impact on existing code
- A lot of code is likely to be refactored to support the usage of the common base source set between the Java SE/EE and Android project. 
- Code will be formatted correctly which is only a cosmetic change.
- Deprecated code will be removed.
- Any usage of the support library will be replaced with the new `AndroidX` counterpart.
- Where possible, we will try to restrict the accessibility of methods using annotations; this allows us to make changes to a wider scope of files in the future that won't be considered breaking.

## Alternatives considered
- We can continue adding more features without removal of old code. This is becoming more and more difficult as time goes on without a breaking change to refactor and streamline the existing code.
