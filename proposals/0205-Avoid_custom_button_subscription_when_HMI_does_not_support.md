# Avoid Custom button subscription in case HMI incompatibility

* Proposal: [SDL-0205](0205-Avoid_custom_button_subscription_when_HMI_does_not_support.md)
* Author: [Getmanets Irina](https://github.com/GetmanetsIrina)
* Status: **In Review**
* Impacted Platforms: [Core]

## Introduction

In case HMI does not support `CUSTOM_BUTTON`, SDL should not try to subscribe an application to it.

## Motivation

SDL does not check hmi_capabilities before subscription to `CUSTOM_BUTTON`, so it tries to subscribe each registered application to `CUSTOM_BUTTON` even if it is unsupported by HMI.

SDL should check hmi_capabilities and subscribe application to `CUSTOM_BUTTON` if it is **supported by HMI only**.

## Proposed solution

SDL should check hmi_capabilities for `CUSTOM_BUTTON` by the start and save support state for `CUSTOM_BUTTON` internally.
On the app registration, SDL should check the saved support state for `CUSTOM_BUTTON`.

In case `CUSTOM_BUTTON` is supported by hmi_capabilities:
SDL should send `Buttons.SubscribeButtons(CUSTOM_BUTTON)` to HMI and wait for a response.


In case `CUSTOM_BUTTON` is not supported by hmi_capabilities:
SDL should **not** send `Buttons.SubscribeButtons(CUSTOM_BUTTON)` to HMI.

If HMI supports `CUSTOM_BUTTON`, it should be in the `Buttons[capabilities]` section of `hmi_capabilities.json`:

```
"Buttons": {
       "capabilities": [
        ...,
        {
               "name": "CUSTOM_BUTTON",
               "shortPressAvailable": true,
               "longPressAvailable": true,
               "upDownAvailable": true
           }
        ]
}
```


If HMI supports `CUSTOM_BUTTON`, response to `Buttons.GetCapabilities` should contain following structure:

```
"capabilities": [
        ...,
        {
               "name": "CUSTOM_BUTTON",
               "shortPressAvailable": true,
               "longPressAvailable": true,
               "upDownAvailable": true
           }
        ]
```


`Buttons.GetCapabilities` request has higher priority than `hmi_capabilities.json`.
