# Adding Audible Status Notification

* Proposal: [SDL-0264](0264-Adding-Audible-Status-Notification.md)
* Author: [Shohei Kawano](https://github.com/Shohei-Kawano)
* Status: **Returned for Revisions**
* Impacted Platforms: [Core / RPC / HMI]

## Introduction

Currently, there is no way to independently notify the Audible status to applications that output audio such as SDL Media.  
This proposal suggests adding `OnAudibleStatus` as a new API so that the status of Audible can be notified.


## Motivation

The motivation for this proposal is to allow the ability to set an Audible status to applications that output audio.  
Currently, the `OnHMIStatus` notification from Core to Mobile can set an Audible state without changing the hmiLevel by using the parameters `audioStreamingState` and hmiLevel
However, there is currently no notification from HMI to Core to set the Audible status,
so a new API to notify the audio status can be added regardless of the screen status.  
As a specific example, there is a specification that allows a user to display and receive an incoming call with Notification, Overlay or ONS without changing to the telephone screen when an incoming call is received.  
In this case, since there is no appropriate API to notify the Audible status independently, using `OnEventChanged (PHONE_CALL)` displays Music App on the screen, but the HMI Level becomes Background.  
As a response method, we propose to add a new API to notify the Audible status. 


## Proposed solution

A new API `OnAudibleStatus` that can be used with the HMI API is added.  
API parameters to be added are `appName` and `audibleState`, so that the target application and Audible status can be notified.  


HMI API  
```xml
<function name="OnAudibleStatus" messagetype="notification">	
    <description>	
        It can notify the Audible status independently of the screen status.	
    </description>	
    <param name="appName" type="String" maxlength="100" mandatory="true">	
        <description> Application Name </description>	
    </param>	
    <param name="audibleState" type="AudibleState" defvalue="AUDIBLE" mandatory="true">	
        <description> See AudibleState. If it is NOT_AUDIBLE, the app must stop voice to SDL Core (stop service). </description>	
    </param>	
</function>	
	
	
<enum name="AudibleState">	
    <description> Enumeration that describes possible states of audio output. </description>	
    <element name="AUDIBLE"/>	
    <element name="ATTENUATED"/>	
    <element name="NOT_AUDIBLE"/>	
</enum>	
```

## Potential downsides

Nothing.


## Impact on existing code

HMI_API needs to be updated.  
SDL Core needs to be updated.
RPC needs to be updated.

## Alternatives considered

I considered only adding parameters to the existing API. However, there is no existing API that suits the purpose, and since the merit of being able to handle audio alone is lost, this does not seem to be a good alternative.
