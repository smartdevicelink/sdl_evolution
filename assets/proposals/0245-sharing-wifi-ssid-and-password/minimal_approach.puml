note over HMI, APP2:  Policy restrictions, encryption_required": true,
APP1 -> SDL : <b>RAI_1(NetworkingCapabilities)
SDL -> HMI : <b>OnAppRegistered(App1, NetworkingCapabilities)

note over HMI : HMI compares own capabilities,\n\
WiFi adapter status, and check if MOBILE or HMI should be AP
APP2 -> SDL : Init Secure RPC service

alt HMI is an access point

alt Vehicle should be an access point
HMI -> SDL : JoinVehicleNetwork (app2)
SDL -> APP2 : JoinVehicleNetwork (app2)
APP2 -> APP2 : Establish \n\
WiFiConnection
APP2 -> SDL : JoinVehicleNetwork response
SDL -> HMI : JoinVehicleNetwork response
HMI -> SDL : JoinVehicleNetwork (app3)
SDL -> APP3 : JoinVehicleNetwork (app3)
APP3 -> APP3 : Establish \n\
WiFiConnectionAPP3 -> SDL : JoinVehicleNetwork response
end

alt Mobile is an access point
note right HMI :  HMI sends OnSystemRequst to the first APP1
HMI -> SDL : OnSystemRequst (APP1) (WIFI_READY_TO_CONNECT)
SDL -> APP1 : OnSystemRequst (WIFI_READY_TO_CONNECT)
APP1 -> SDL : JoinMobileNetwork (app1)
SDL -> HMI : JoinMobileNetwork (app1)
HMI -> SDL : JoinMobileNetwork response
SDL -> APP1 : JoinMobileNetwork response
note right HMI :  HMI shares credentials of the APP1
HMI -> SDL : JoinVehicleNetwork (app3)
SDL -> APP3 : JoinVehicleNetwork (app3)
APP3 -> SDL : JoinVehicleNetwork response
SDL -> HMI : JoinVehicleNetwork response
